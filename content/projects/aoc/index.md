# Advent of Code 2024

In December of 2024, I worked with C++20 to earn the maximum 50 stars for that year's Advent of Code competition. 

[My AoC Repo](https://github.com/seanwilliamcarroll/aoc)

I had heard about AoC for a few years, but I'd always remember it mid December and I'd feel a bit behind when attempting it. So I was glad to complete it from start to finish this year!


Looking forward to trying more in future years!
